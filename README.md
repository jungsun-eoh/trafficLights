# TrafficLight
Create a Traffic Light, using one Red, one Yellow, and one Green LED with Raspberry Pi. 
The Green LED should be on for 6 seconds, then the light should switch to the Yellow light which should be on for 1.5 seconds, then switch to Red for 5 seconds. Then repeat the cycle 2 more times.

To do that, I use 2 different way,
  1. WiringPi Library
  2. sysfs interface
